"Build a beautifully designed, multi-page, React + Tailwind CSS frontend-only website for a newly launched IT consulting startup that offers modern tech services. The site should focus on visual appeal, clarity, and client engagement to create trust and allow visitors to explore the company vision and register interest. This is a static client-side site with zero backend at this stage, but the structure should be prepared for future backend/API integration."

🔍 Context and Constraints:
🚀 Client: Brand new IT Consulting Startup

🛠 Purpose: Build trust and collect early client interest

🧱 No backend or database — only frontend React code

🎯 Goal: Create high-converting UI/UX, highly modular and professional

🌗 Theme: Light + Dark Mode toggle

📱 Fully Responsive — mobile-first design

🔮 Future-Proof: Structure code for API/backend expansion later

🖼️ Image/Text Data: Use dummy or placeholder data with modular JSON config

📁 1. Tech Stack & Tools:
✅ React.js (functional components, hooks)

✅ React Router DOM v6+ (for multi-page routing)

✅ Tailwind CSS (utility-first, dark mode, fully responsive)

✅ Heroicons or Lucide for icons

✅ Framer Motion (for optional smooth animations)

✅ Headless UI (for accessibility-ready dropdowns/modals)

Avoid hardcoded strings in components — use props and JSON-driven rendering

Keep code DRY, comment complex logic, and split into small units
